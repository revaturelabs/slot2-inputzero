### Tell me about yourself 

#### Project
 - I worked on a Project Name
 - describe your project:
 - the userstories/modules/ responsiblites you've worked on  
 - technologies used: In these project, we've used Angular to develop a front end and 
		      Spring as a backend.
 - dataflow (user stories/when you explain)

## Java

### Java Basics
Java -> features, JVM/JRE/JDK, platform independent
(what do you know about java, what's experience with ur java)

control statements -> for, for each, do while, while , if , if else, switch
(problem solving, predict the output, error debugging)

access modifiers -> private, public, protected and default

non access modifiers -> static , final -> variable, method, class

### Arrays

Arrays -> declare, addding element to an array, accessing any element
          .length attribute, 1D array, 2D array

### Strings

Strings -> immutables, string pool, 

String s  = "Porkodi" -> String literal
String s  = new String("Porkodi") -> String object

How java stores string literal and string object
== vs equals
String methods -> .length(), .charAt(), .substring(), toUpperCase()/toLowerCase(),
		.concat(), replace()

String Builder and String Buffer -> difference, threadsafe, which slower or faster

//reverse a string
String s = sc.next();
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(s);
sb.reverse();
String rev_s = sb.toString();
		 
thread -> program in execution
main thread -> main method
multiple threads are created to perform the task simulante

### Stack vs heap memory

Car c  = new Car()

stack

c -> 23578136487

heap -> data inside the object

### OOP

OOPs -> a pie -> what is it, example, how to implement in java


functional Interface -> has only one abstract method 

### Exceptions

Exceptions -> checked and unchecked exceptions, custom exceptions, try, catch, finally, throw, throws
throws always will be in our method declaration ->  saying this methods amy throw an exception

throw is keyword -> throwing an exception object -> inside{ }



in the try block

m1() -> m2() -> m3()
when? you have more method calls, and each of them may throw exceptions

in which method its happened(m2)
who called the methods (m1)
the entire history/flow of method calls(main -> m1 -> m2)
-> to know you can use printstack tree()


### Problems to be solved (Try these problems with collections)

1. Given a list of integers, find out all the even numbers exist in the list
2. Given a list of integers, find out all the numbers starting with 1
3. How to find duplicate elements in a given integers list in java
4. Given a list of integers, find the maximum/minimun value element present in it
5. Given a String, find the first non-repeated character in it
6. Given a String, find the first repeated character in it
7. Given a list of integers, sort all the values present in it
8. Given a list of integers, sort all the values present in it in descending order
